## Key Patterns Across Examples

**Consistent transformations:**
1. Remove AI-tells: delve, facilitate, robust, Moreover, etc.
2. Add contractions appropriate to context
3. Vary sentence length dramatically
4. Replace formal transitions with natural ones
5. Use active voice and concrete verbs
6. Add personal voice markers

**Context-specific adjustments:**
- Academic: Keep sophistication, lighter touch
- Professional: Clear and direct, some formality
- Personal/blog: Maximum personality, fragments OK
- Technical: Simplify but stay accurate
- Social: Very casual, very short sentences

**The secret:** Read it aloud. If you wouldn't say it out loud to a colleague or friend, rewrite it.
