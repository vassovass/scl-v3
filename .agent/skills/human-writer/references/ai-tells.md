## Human Alternatives

**Instead of AI words, use:**

- Natural connectors: and, but, so, because, also, besides, plus
- Casual transitions: anyway, basically, essentially, actually, honestly, look
- Real language: thing, stuff (in casual contexts), bit, kind of
- Active voice: "We did it" not "It was done"
- Contractions: don't, can't, won't, it's, we're, they're

## Context Notes

**Academic writing:** Some formal language is expected, but avoid AI clichés
**Professional emails:** Keep it clear and direct - "use" not "utilize"  
**Blog posts/casual:** Maximize simple, conversational language
**TEFL assignments:** Show teacher voice - natural but not sloppy
