# Linguistic Patterns: AI vs Human Writing

Research-backed differences between AI-generated and human-written text, synthesized from multiple academic studies (2023-2025).

## Key Finding: Burstiness

**Human writing has high "burstiness"** - dramatic variation in sentence length.
**AI writing has low "burstiness"** - consistent medium-length sentences.

### Metrics
- Humans: Mix 5-word sentences with 35-word sentences in same paragraph
- AI: Tends toward 15-25 word sentences consistently
- ChatGPT/Claude/Llama: Show less than 30% of the sentence length variation humans display

### Application
Create deliberate contrast:
- Very short: 3-8 words
- Short: 9-15 words  
- Medium: 16-25 words
- Long: 26-40 words
- Occasionally: 40+ words for complex ideas

**Pattern:** short-short-long-medium-short creates natural rhythm

## Perplexity (Word Predictability)

**AI text = low perplexity** (highly predictable word choices)
**Human text = higher perplexity** (more surprising word choices)

### Why This Matters
- AI picks statistically likely next words
- Humans pick contextually interesting or emotionally resonant words
- AI rarely uses low-probability tokens
- Humans regularly use unexpected but fitting words

### Application
- Vary word choice even when synonyms exist
- Use specific rather than generic language
- Include occasional unexpected but apt word choices
- Don't always pick the "obvious" adjective or verb

## Grammatical Patterns

### Present Participial Clauses
**AI:** Uses 2-5x more than humans
**Example:** "Brian, leaning on his agility, dances around the ring, evading Show's heavy blows."

**Human alternative:** "Brian leans on his agility. He dances around the ring and evades Show's heavy blows."

### Nominalizations
**AI:** Uses 1.5-2x more than humans
- Implementation, utilization, optimization, transformation

**Human alternative:** 
- Implementing, using, optimizing, transforming (verb forms)

### Passive Voice (Agentless)
**AI (GPT-4):** Uses 50% LESS agentless passive than humans
**Explanation:** AI trained to favor active voice, sometimes overcorrects

**Human writing:** Actually uses passive voice more naturally
**Application:** It's OK to use passive voice when appropriate:
- "The study was conducted in 2024"
- "The building was destroyed"

### Sentence Structure Variety
**AI pattern:** 
- 60% simple declarative sentences
- 30% compound sentences with "and"
- 10% complex structures

**Human pattern:**
- 40% simple declarative
- 20% compound
- 20% complex with subordinate clauses  
- 10% fragments
- 10% questions, exclamations, other

## Lexical Features

### Vocabulary Diversity
**AI:** Richer, more diverse vocabulary technically (type-token ratio)
**BUT:** Often inappropriately sophisticated for context
**Human:** Smaller working vocabulary, repeated common words, context-appropriate

### Application
Don't try to use varied vocabulary everywhere:
- Repeat "said" instead of "articulated, expressed, verbalized, conveyed"
- Use "good" multiple times instead of "excellent, superb, outstanding"
- Common words are natural: thing, stuff, get, make, do

### Adverbial Modifiers
**AI:** Uses adverbial modifiers more frequently
**Example:** "carefully considered," "thoroughly analyzed," "deeply explored"

**Human:** Uses them more sparingly
**Application:** Remove unnecessary adverbs - let verbs stand alone

## Rhetorical and Stylistic Features

### Interactional Metadiscourse
**Human writing shows MORE:**
- Hedges: "probably," "might," "seems," "appears"
- Boosters: "definitely," "clearly," "obviously" (but use sparingly)
- Attitude markers: "surprisingly," "unfortunately," "hopefully"
- Self-mention: "I think," "in my view," "from my perspective"

**AI writing shows LESS:**
- Lower frequency of stance markers
- More neutral, expository tone
- Less personal engagement with reader
- Fewer expressions of uncertainty or commitment

### Application
Add strategic metadiscourse:
- Hedges show critical thinking: "This might suggest..."
- Attitude markers show personality: "Interestingly..."
- Self-reference adds voice: "I'd argue that..."

### Engagement Markers
**Human:** Direct reader address, questions, imperatives
**AI:** Avoids direct engagement

**Human examples:**
- "You know what I mean?"
- "Let's think about this..."
- "Consider this example:"
- "Wait - there's more."

## Cognitive Load Markers

**Humans under cognitive load show:**
- Simpler sentence structures
- More revisions and self-corrections
- Strategic pauses (fragments, dashes)
- Occasional incomplete thoughts

**AI shows:**
- Consistent fluency throughout
- No cognitive strain markers
- Perfect continuation even on complex topics
- No natural hesitations

### Application
Add cognitive markers strategically:
- Self-correction: "Well, actually..."
- Hesitation: "I'm not sure if..."
- Simplification: Break complex idea mid-sentence
- Incomplete: End with "..." occasionally

## Emotional and Personal Elements

### Named Entities
**Human:** References to real, specific people, places, events from experience
**AI:** Generic or inconsistent named entities, may fabricate

**Application:**
- Use specific examples when possible
- Reference real situations (hedged)
- Avoid fabricating specific names/dates
- Generic is OK if clearly generic: "most people I know"

### Emotional Expression
**Human:** Varied, contextual, sometimes contradictory emotions
**AI:** Consistent emotional tone, sometimes artificially maintained

**Application:**
- Show emotional variation: "I was frustrated, but also kind of excited"
- Natural contradictions: "It's annoying but necessary"
- Context-appropriate emotion markers

## Register Variation

**AI limitation:** Struggles to maintain consistent register
**AI tendency:** Defaults to informational/academic register
- Higher lexical density
- More explicit cohesion devices
- Noun-heavy style

**Human strength:** Natural register switching
- Casual when appropriate
- Formal when needed
- Mixed registers mid-text when contextually appropriate

### Application
Match register to context strictly:
- TEFL assignment: Professional teacher voice (medium formality)
- Blog post: Conversational (low formality)
- Academic essay: Scholarly but not robotic (high formality)
- Email: Clear and direct (medium formality)

## Cohesion Devices

**AI overuses:**
- Explicit transitions: Moreover, Furthermore, In addition
- Heavy signposting: "First," "Second," "Finally"
- Formal connectors: Thus, Hence, Therefore

**Humans use more:**
- Implicit connections (no connector)
- Simple and, but, so
- Casual transitions: Anyway, Besides, Plus
- Topic continuity without markers

### Application
- Remove 60% of formal transitions
- Replace with: and, but, so, plus, also
- Use implicit connections (no connector) 30% of the time
- Save "Moreover/Furthermore" for only the most formal contexts

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vary sentence length dramatically** - this is the #1 tell
2. **Use contractions freely** - unless context forbids
3. **Remove AI-favorite words** - delve, tapestry, robust, etc.
4. **Add imperfection** - hedge words, self-correction, thinking markers
5. **Simplify vocabulary** - common words repeated > varied fancy words
6. **Include personal voice** - I think, seems like, probably
7. **Use natural transitions** - and, but, so > moreover, furthermore
8. **Add fragments and questions** - break perfect grammar occasionally
9. **Show cognitive load** - hesitation, simplification when appropriate
10. **Match register to context** - don't default to academic formality
