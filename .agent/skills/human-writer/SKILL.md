# Human Writer

Transform AI-sounding text into authentic, natural human writing by applying research-backed linguistic patterns and stylistic techniques.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Text sounds too formal, robotic, or AI-generated
- Writing needs to pass as genuinely human for assignments, applications, or professional contexts
- Content lacks personality, variation, or natural flow
- User explicitly requests "human-sounding," "natural," or "less AI-like" writing
- Rewriting essays, blog posts, emails, reports, or any text where authentic voice matters

## Core Approach

Apply these transformations in sequence:

### 1. Sentence Variation (Burstiness)

Human writing naturally varies sentence length dramatically. AI defaults to medium-length sentences.

**Apply:**
- Mix very short sentences (3-7 words) with longer complex ones (20-35 words)
- Use occasional fragments for emphasis
- Vary sentence starters - avoid repetitive patterns
- Break up dense paragraphs with punchy statements

**Example transformation:**
- AI: "The research demonstrates that machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data efficiently. This capability enables organizations to make better decisions. The technology continues to evolve rapidly."
- Human: "Machine learning processes massive datasets fast. That's the core capability. Organizations leverage this to make smarter decisions, and the technology? It keeps evolving at breakneck speed."

### 2. Remove AI Tell-Tale Words and Phrases

AI models overuse specific words that humans rarely employ. See `references/ai-tells.md` for comprehensive list.

**Common offenders to reduce/remove:**
- Overused: delve, tapestry, camaraderie, palpable, intricate, unease, robust, crucial, vital, realm, landscape (metaphorical)
- Filler transitions: Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, In addition, Thus, Hence, Therefore (use sparingly)
- Overly formal: Utilize (use "use"), Commence (use "start"), Facilitate (use "help")

**Replace with:**
- Natural connectors: And, But, So, Plus, Also, Besides
- Casual transitions: Anyway, Basically, Essentially, Look
- Concrete verbs: Make, do, fix, build, create, help

### 3. Add Contractions and Informal Language

AI defaults to formal constructions. Humans use contractions freely in most contexts except highly formal academic/legal writing.

**Apply liberally:**
- Don't, can't, won't, it's, I'm, we're, they're, you're
- Wanna, gonna (in very casual contexts only)
- Colloquialisms appropriate to context

**BUT avoid in:**
- Academic research papers
- Legal documents
- Formal business proposals
- When user specifically requests formal tone

### 4. Vary Sentence Structure

AI overuses certain grammatical patterns. Humans naturally vary structure.

**AI overuses:**
- Present participial clauses: "Walking down the street, seeing the crowd..." (use 50% less)
- Nominalizations: "implementation" → "implementing," "utilization" → "using"
- Agentless passive voice

**Add more:**
- Simple active voice: "The team built it" not "It was built by the team"
- Questions mid-paragraph: "But does that really work?"
- Direct address: "You know what I mean?"

### 5. Inject Personal Voice and Imperfection

Humans think aloud, hesitate, correct themselves, and show personality.

**Add strategically:**
- Hedge words: kind of, sort of, pretty much, a bit, somewhat (don't overdo)
- Thinking markers: I think, I feel, seems like, looks like
- Self-correction: "Well, actually..." "Or rather..." "I mean..."
- Qualifiers: mostly, often, usually, typically
- Minor redundancy: "completely finished," "end result"

**Example:**
- AI: "The solution effectively addresses the problem."
- Human: "This solution pretty much solves the problem, though there's probably room for improvement."

### 6. Use Natural Collocations and Idioms

AI sometimes creates unnatural word pairings. Humans use familiar phrases.

**Check for natural pairings:**
- Make the bed (not do the bed)
- Do the dishes (not make the dishes)
- Strong coffee (not powerful coffee)
- Heavy rain (not strong rain)

**Add appropriate idioms:**
- "Hit the ground running"
- "Cut to the chase"
- "Get the ball rolling"
- Context-appropriate only - don't force them

### 7. Create Contextual Depth

Humans draw from experience and add specific details. AI stays generic.

**Add when appropriate:**
- Specific examples instead of generalizations
- Real-world references (but avoid fabricating facts)
- Analogies and comparisons
- Personal observations or hedged experiences

**Example:**
- AI: "Many people enjoy coffee in the morning."
- Human: "Most people I know can't function without coffee before 9am. Myself included."

## Progressive Application

For different output requirements:

**Light humanization (professional contexts):**
- Apply sentence variation
- Add occasional contractions
- Remove most AI-tells
- Keep sophisticated vocabulary

**Medium humanization (blog posts, emails):**
- Full sentence variation including fragments
- Generous contractions
- Natural transitions
- Some personal voice
- Occasional idioms

**Heavy humanization (casual writing, personal essays):**
- Maximum variation including very short sentences
- Frequent contractions
- Personal anecdotes and voice
- Hedge words and thinking markers
- Colloquialisms and idioms
- Self-correction patterns

## Important Considerations

**Preserve:**
- Original meaning and key arguments
- Factual accuracy
- Technical terms when necessary
- Core structure and organization

**Context awareness:**
- Academic writing: lighter touch, keep sophistication, minimal contractions
- Professional emails: medium touch, maintain clarity and professionalism
- Blog posts/casual content: heavier touch, maximize personality
- TEFL assignments: medium-heavy touch, show natural teacher voice

**Quality checks:**
- Read aloud - does it sound like someone talking?
- Check sentence length variation visually
- Verify no more than 2-3 consecutive sentences start the same way
- Ensure personality without sacrificing clarity

## Quick Self-Check

After transformation, verify:
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary dramatically (some under 8 words, some over 20)
- [ ] At least 3-5 contractions per 200 words (unless formal context)
- [ ] No "delve," "tapestry," "robust" or similar AI-tells
- [ ] At least one sentence fragment or very short sentence per paragraph
- [ ] Natural transitions (And, But, So) outnumber formal ones
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Includes at least one thinking marker or hedge word per 150 words
